# A Computational Analysis of Math and Reading Testing Results Within a Designated School District.

## Overview of A School District Analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis:
The purpose of this project was to analyze test results for two standardized reading and mathamatical comprehension exams. The analysist ocurred between 15 different schools residing within the same district. The schools were not only compared based on statistics pertaining to how well students performed academically, but various factors such as: school size, budget, and type were also considered. After the initial analysis, Thomas High School's 9th grade class was accused of academic dishonesty, and the analyst was asked to remove their test scores and re-analyze to reflect more-accurrate data.

## Results: address the following questions.

### How is the district summary affected?
*  After the removal of Thomas High School's 9th grade test scores, the metrics shifted.



### How is the school summary affected?
*  After the removal of Thomas HighSchool's 9th grade students, 
*  
### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

### - Math and reading scores by grade
### - Scores by school spending
### - Scores by school size
### - Scores by school type



## Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
