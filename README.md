# A Computational Analysis of Math and Reading Testing Results Within a Designated School District.

## Overview of A School District Analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis:
The purpose of this project was to analyze test results for two standardized reading and mathamatical comprehension exams. The analysist ocurred between 15 different schools residing within the same district. The schools were not only compared based on statistics pertaining to how well students performed academically, but various factors such as: school size, budget, and type were also considered. After the initial analysis, Thomas High School's 9th grade class was accused of academic dishonesty, and the analyst was asked to remove their test scores and re-analyze to reflect more-accurrate data.

## Results: address the following questions.

### How is the district summary affected?
*  After the removal of Thomas High School's 9th grade test scores:
   *  the District's overall passing rate was reduced from 65.2% of students passing both exams to 64.9%.
   *  The passing math percentage  was reduced from 75.8% to 74.8%.
   *  The passing reading percentage was reduced from 86.1% to 85.7%.
*  This removal was not a significant disturbance to the district's testing metrics.

### How is the school summary affected?
*  The school summary at its basic level was not signicantly affected. It compared all 15 schools to one another and the academic dishonesty metric-change was isolated solely within the Thomas High school dataset. 
  *  When analyzing top 5 schools, pre and post removal, Thomas High School remained in 2nd place throughout the re-analysis. However the academic percntages were slightly reduced.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
*  After removing the scores, Thomas High School's preformance did not significantly change relative to other schools. It maintained it's ranking in the top-5 schools even with the removal of the 9th grade scores.
_________________________________________________________
### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

### - Math and reading scores by grade
*  Average scores based on grade were slightly altered.
  *  Grades 10-12 were not altered from the data deletions.
  * Grade 9 saw a reduction on average passing rates due to data deletion.
### - Scores by school spending
*  Average Scores based on spending rate was not altered.
  * Deleted data was not significantly significant on a district whole.
### - Scores by school size
*  Average scores by school size was not altered.
  *  Deleted data was not significantly significant on a district whole.
### - Scores by school type
*  Average scores by school type were slightly altered. 
  *  Chartered schools still ranked higher in academic performance compared to their district counterparts, but passing rates were slightly reduced.
